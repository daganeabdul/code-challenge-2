Event Guest List Manager

Project Description

What is this project?

The Event Guest List Manager is a simple, interactive web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to manage guest names for an event by adding, updating, categorizing, and deleting entries in real time without refreshing the browser.

How does it work?

Users enter guest names into a form input. On submission, the name is added to a visible list with options to:

 Remove the guest
 Mark their RSVP status:  Attending /Not Attending
 Categorize them, e.g, Friend, Family, Colleague
 Edit their name
 View the time they were added

The list is limited to 10 guests to avoid overcrowding.

Who are the users?

This tool is designed for:

 Event organizers
 Students learning front-end development
 Anyone managing small event guest lists

What are the benefits for the users?

 Easily track who’s attending an event
 Get hands-on practice with DOM manipulation
 Learn how forms and events work in real-time applications

What is the goal of this project?

To provide a fun, practical exercise for improving core JavaScript skills- especially around forms, event handling, DOM updates, and state management- while building something useful.
