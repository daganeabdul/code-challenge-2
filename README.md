 Project Description
 What is this project?
The Event Guest List Manager is a web-based tool that allows users to add, update, categorize, and delete guest names dynamically without refreshing the browser.
 How does it work?
Users can:
- Enter a guest name into a form
- On submission, the name is added to a visible list
- Perform actions like:

  -  Mark RSVP: Attending / Not Attending
  -  Remove the guest
  -  Edit the guest's name
  -  Categorize: Friend, Family, Colleague
  -  View timestamp of when the guest was added

 N/B: : The guest list is limited to 10 entries  to avoid overcrowding.

-  Event organizers
-  Students learning front-end development
-  Anyone managing small event guest lists

 What are the benefits?
